<h2>What is this place?</h2>
<p> This is a place for me to write, display my projects and whatever else I end up doing. I wanted to be able to write my blog from a terminal anywhere in the world and love the simplicity of <a href ="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>. </p>
<p> Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>
